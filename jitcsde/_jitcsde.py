#: the symbol for the state that must be used to define the differential equation. It is a function and the integer argument denotes the component. You may just as well define an analogous function directly with SymEngine or SymPy, but using this function is the best way to get the most of future versions of JiTCSDE, in particular avoiding incompatibilities. You can import a SymPy variant from the submodule `sympy_symbols` instead (see `SymPy vs. SymEngine`_ for details).

	Parameters
	----------
	f_sym : iterable of symbolic expressions or generator function yielding symbolic expressions or dictionary
		If an iterable or generator function, the `i`-th element is the `i`-th component of the value of the SDE’s drift term :math:`f(t,y)`. If a dictionary, it has to map the dynamical variables to its derivatives and the dynamical variables must be `y(0), y(1), …`.
	
	g_sym : iterable of symbolic expressions or generator function yielding symbolic expressions or dictionary
		If an iterable or generator function, the `i`-th element is the `i`-th component of the value of the SDE’s diffusion term :math:`f(t,y)`. If a dictionary, it has to map the dynamical variables to its derivatives and the dynamical variables must be `y(0), y(1), …`.
	
	helpers : list of length-two iterables, each containing a symbol and an expression
		Each helper is a variable that will be calculated before evaluating the drift and diffusion terms and can be used in their computation. The first component of the tuple is the helper’s symbol as referenced in the drift and diffusion terms or other helpers, the second component describes how to compute it from `t`, `y` and other helpers. This is for example useful to realise a mean-field coupling, where the helper could look like `(mean, sum(y(i) for i in range(100))/100)`. (See `the JiTCODE documentation <http://jitcode.readthedocs.io/#module-SW_of_Roesslers>`_ for an example.)
	
	g_helpers : `"auto"` (default), `"same"`, or like `helpers`
	
		* If `"auto"`, JiTCSDE will automatically determine which helpers are needed for `f` and `g`. The only drawback of this is that it may take some time for larger differential equations.
		* If `"same"`, `helpers` will be used for both `f` and `g` as it is.
		* If this is a list of helpers (or empty list), `helpers` will be used only for calculating `f` and `g_helpers` for `g`.
	
	n : integer
		Length of `f_sym` and `g_sym`, i.e., the dimension of the system. While JiTCSDE can easily determine this itself (and will, if necessary), this may take some time if `f_sym` is a generator function and `n` is large. Take care that this value is correct – if it isn’t, you will not get a helpful error message.
	
	additive : None or boolean
		Whether the noise term is additive, i.e., `g_sym` is independent of the state (`y`). In this case a simpler, faster integrator can be used. While JiTCSDE can easily determine this itself (and will, if necessary), this may take some time if `n` is large. If you incorrectly set this to `True`, you will not get a helpful error message.
	
	ito : boolean
		Whether the SDE is formulated in Itō or Stratonovitch calculus.
		In the latter case, the SDE will be converted to Itō calculus, as this is what is required by the integrator.
		Note that is conversion may be inefficient for large differential equations with helpers.
	
	control_pars : list of symbols
		Each symbol corresponds to a control parameter that can be used when defining the equations and set after compilation with `set_parameters`. Using this makes sense if you need to do a parameter scan with short integrations for each parameter and you are spending a considerable amount of time compiling.
	
	callback_functions : iterable
		Python functions that should be called at integration time (callback) when evaluating the derivative. Each element of the iterable represents one callback function as a tuple containing (in that order):
		
		*	A SymEngine function object used in `f_sym` to represent the function call. If you want to use any JiTCSDE features that need the derivative, this must have a properly defined `f_diff` method with the derivative being another callback function (or constant).
		*	The Python function to be called. This function will receive the state array (`y`) as the first argument. All further arguments are whatever you use as arguments of the SymEngine function in `f_sym`. These can be any expression that you might use in the definition of the derivative and contain, e.g., dynamical variables, time, control parameters, and helpers. The only restriction is that the arguments are floats (and not vectors or similar). The return value must also be a float (or something castable to float). It is your responsibility to ensure that this function adheres to these criteria, is deterministic and sufficiently smooth with respect its arguments; expect nasty errors otherwise.
		*	The number of arguments, **excluding** the state array as mandatory first argument. This means if you have a variadic Python function, you cannot just call it with different numbers of arguments in `f_sym`, but you have to define separate callbacks for each of number of arguments.
		
		See `this example <https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcdde/blob/master/examples/sunflower_callback.py>`_ (for JiTCDDE) for how to use this.
	
	verbose : boolean
		Whether JiTCSDE shall give progress reports on the processing steps.
	
	module_location : string
		location of a module file from which functions are to be loaded (see `save_compiled`). If you use this, you need not give `f_sym` and `g_sym` as arguments, but in this case you must give `n`. If you used `control_pars` or `callback_functions`, you have to provide them again. Also note that the integrator may lack some functionalities, depending on the arguments you provide.

		Parameters
		----------
		simplify : boolean
			Whether the derivative should be `simplified <http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/simplify/simplify.html>`_ (with `ratio=1.0`) before translating to C code. The main reason why you could want to disable this is if your derivative is already  optimised and so large that simplifying takes a considerable amount of time. If `None`, this will be automatically disabled for `n>10`.
		
		do_cse : boolean
			Whether SymPy’s `common-subexpression detection <http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/rewriting.html#module-sympy.simplify.cse_main>`_ should be applied before translating to C code.
			It is almost always better to let the compiler do this (unless you want to set the compiler optimisation to `-O2` or lower). As this requires all entries of `f` and `g` at once, it may void advantages gained from using generator functions as an input. Also, this feature uses SymPy and not SymEngine.
		
		numpy_rng : boolean
			Whether `numpy.random.normal` shall be explicitly employed for generating random numbers. This is less efficient and mainly exists for testing purposes to ensure that the random numbers are the same as when using the Python backend. Note that the alternative is still based on the same code as NumPy’s random-number generator (until somebody changes it) and should produce the same results. Also note that details in the arithmetic realisation may still cause tiny differences in the results from the two backends, which can then be magnified by the butterfly effect.
		
		chunk_size : integer
			If the number of instructions in the final C code exceeds this number, it will be split into chunks of this size. See `Handling very large differential equations <http://jitcde-common.readthedocs.io/#handling-very-large-differential-equations>`_ on why this is useful and how to best choose this value.
			If smaller than 1, no chunking will happen.
		
		extra_compile_args : iterable of strings
		extra_link_args : iterable of strings
			Arguments to be handed to the C compiler or linker, respectively.
		
		verbose : boolean
			Whether the compiler commands shall be shown. This is the same as Setuptools’ `verbose` setting.

		modulename : string or `None`
			The name used for the compiled module.
		
		omp : pair of iterables of strings or boolean
			What compiler arguments shall be used for multiprocessing (using OpenMP). If `True`, they will be selected automatically. If empty or `False`, no compilation for multiprocessing will happen (unless you supply the relevant compiler arguments otherwise).

		Fills the noise memory with a realisation of the underlying Wiener process sampled at `number` points with a distance of `step_size` (i.e., for a total length of `number`·`step_size`).
		
		This is mainly intended for testing purposes, e.g., if you want to investigate the influence of the step-size-adjustment parameters in a controlled setting. Note that this only pins the Wiener process at the specified points. All other points will have to be interpolated with a Brownian bridge, but the lower the `step_size`, the more constrained they will be. Note that this inevitably slows things down.

	Parameters
	----------

	IJI : callable `IJI(time,state)` returning a non-negative number
		A function (or similar) that returns a waiting time for the next jump, i.e., that draws one value from the inter-jump-interval distribution. A new waiting time using this function is determined directly after each jump (and at the first call of `integrate`). Hence, only the state and time at those times affect the waiting time, if you choose it to be time- or state-dependent.
	
	amp : callable `amp(time,state)` returning an array of size `n`.
		A function (or similar) that returns the actual jump.
		This must be a NumPy array, even if your system is one-dimensional.
