"""
As an example, suppose that we want to add jumps to the noisy Lorenz oscillator from `example`.
These shall have exponentially distributed waiting times (i.e. they are a Poisson process) with a scale parameter :math:`β=1.0`.
A function sampling such waiting times (inter-jump intervals) is:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/noisy_and_jumpy_lorenz.py
	:dedent: 1
	:lines: 49-50

Note that since our waiting times are neither state- nor time-dependent, we do not use the `time` and `state` argument.
Next, we want the jumps to only apply to the last component, being normally distributed with zero mean and the current amplitude of this component as a standard deviation.
A function producing such a jump is:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/noisy_and_jumpy_lorenz.py
	:dedent: 1
	:lines: 52-57

Finally, we initialise the integrator using `jitcsde_jump` instead of `jitcsde` with the previously defined functions as additional arguments:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/noisy_and_jumpy_lorenz.py
	:dedent: 1
	:lines: 59

Everything else remains unchanged.
See `the sources <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neurophysik/jitcsde/master/examples/noisy_and_jumpy_lorenz.py>`_ for the full example.
